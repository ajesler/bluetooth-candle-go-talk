          Presentation goal:
          Show people how to take a random bluetooth device they have and create a control library for it
          Give them the tools and understanding of the process to reverse engineer their own devices

          Android and OSX centric.

          Sections:
          - The device
            - MiPow bluetooth LE candle. $15 or so from an online store
            - Wanted to control it from my laptop as a message notifier, then see what we can do.

          - The app
            - Downloaded from the Android store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mipow.androidplaybulbcolor
            - Gives an idea of the devices functions and capabilities

          - Bluetooth LE - how it works
            - quite different to old BT stream
            - discovery
            - services
            - characteristics (read/write)

          - Where to start for reverse engineering?
          - Could decompile the app, but thats a lot of work to comprehend
            - apktool, dex2jar, jd-gui

          - Let the app do the work for us
            - Capture a packet log from the app in use
              - Bluetooth packet capture on the Android device + wireshark. No need to root device.
                - configuration: Bluetooth HCI snoop log
                - Turn on in options, and `adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/btsnoop_hci.log` or `/sdcard/btsnoop_hci.log`
                - Now time to use wireshark to see what is happening
                - http://nilhcem.com/iot/reverse-engineering-simple-bluetooth-devices - same device!

          - Creating a capture to work from
            - Write down the time you started, and start a stopwatch
            - Do an action on the app, and note the time. Start with the simplest actions.
            - leave ~20 seconds between actions

          - Take your capture file, load into wireshark, and ready to analyse
            - This is the hard part, you are looking for patterns, and diffing lines

          - Creating a control library
            - Bluetooth stacks different on diff platforms
            - No cross platform BT LE lib
              - https://github.com/go-ble/ble
              - https://github.com/currantlabs/gatt
            - Add a CLI for scripting, quite handy when testing
            - Start with the simplest features, and refine as you implement more complex ones

          - Fuzzing for new features
            - Script to use our new command lib to try command ranges. Sometimes you can find undocumented modes.
            - script to check response, we don't need to power cycle it. Eg read battery status

          - Using the control library
            - meetings app - wired into google calendar to let you extend meetings
              - callbacks

          - Creating a brew formula
            - tools for checking the formula
